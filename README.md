Big fan of VR, not a big fan of typing in VR.
This program, styled as an inverted ASETNIOP chording keyboard, allows you to type in VR without being anchored to a keyboard!
Built in summer 2024, but especially relevant with Meta's EMG Wristband and the subsequent explosion of potential for hand tracking.

##Build Instructions

All files are tested with Unity 2022.3.5f1. Settings are pre-configured for an Android build, make sure to set the Run Device to your VR headset. Optionally, the program can also be run in the Unity editor through Quest Link.
